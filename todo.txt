Animation:
    extends Group etc
    methods in the class scaffold
Left,right,center alignment options for:
    shapes
    image? I guess?
Text:
    uses penstroke for fill
    backgrond if true, uses fill for a block of colour behind the text
    height,width properties
    textSize
    Font    
Sound:
    load
    max - limits how many instances can play at once
    volume
    play
    loop
    isPlaying
    onFinish - callback holder
Game:
    world:
        force
            x
            y
        you can bind things to the world to allow it to effect them
    sprite:
        velocity system
        limited sensor system
            can do circle or square checking if x or y in it
            can be checked against goodCollider 
        attachement points for:
            colliders
            animations
    goodCollider: <- more expensive, better more complex behaviour
        collision stuff
        >circleCollider
        >lineCollider
        >rectangleCollider

notes:
    want to do rollback eventually where things will store their state from up to x rollback frames ago
